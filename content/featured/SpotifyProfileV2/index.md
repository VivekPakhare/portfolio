I built a currency converter chatbot that understands natural language queries and provides real-time currency conversion results. The chatbot was designed using Dialogflow and deployed on Telegram for easy accessibility.

The bot allows users to convert currencies using simple conversational phrases like “convert 100 USD to INR” or “how much is 50 euros in dollars.” It integrates with a live exchange-rate API via webhooks to ensure accurate and up-to-date conversions.
